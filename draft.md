> Why do civilizations collapse? Is our civilization in danger?

It is common knowledge that a civilization collapse for multivariate reasons, but such reasons can be unified under the perspective of the theory of meme while involving biological methodologies in historical study.

## The meme

Every civilization can be regarded as a meme (an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme). It attains energy with people's contribution to it, both cultural and technological, strengthening its power against harsh environment and discord respectively, like species consuming energy in trophic levels, and reproduces by increasing its recognition among a wider range of crowd. At the same time, all external factors --- natural or anthropogenic --- makes up the biophysical environment where the civilization lives. In such meaning, a civilization acts like a living creature, while many biological theories should remain applicable. Similar to a creature's extinction, it can be inducted that most civilization collapses because of loss in ecological niche.

## The ecological niche

In ecology, a niche is the match of a species to a specific environmental condition. A species takes and enjoys the niche often because it reaches a local optimum in the efficiency of the energy flowing process, which blocks its competitors out. Generally, the loss in ecological niche may be because:

- The niche has vanished as environment changes; or

- A more energy-efficient competitor has replaced the original species.

Such reasons are sound applied to civilizations. 

The civilization based on Confucianism ideology had ruled China and surrounding regions for millenniums but rapidly collapsed in the 20th century, when the long-lasted family-based agricultural mode of production was ruined by industrialization and urbanization. Those changes to the environment dissolved its ecological niche --- nobody would need its social functions any more, therefore it is not surprising that Confucianism lost all its believers and died in the new era. This phenomenon goes to an extremity when it comes to the Easter Island. The residents were the only Polynesians who had invented a writing system and built hundreds of giant statues. However, due to environmental degradation, its population had once dropped to less than $\frac 1 4$ of the peak, with the collapse of a complex social structure and retrogression of technology.

Also, a civilization's ecological niche can be taken by another one, sometimes along with conflicts or revolutions. Take the Christianity religion and the hellaenic polytheism before for example. Instead of being only the aristocrat class's affairs, the newly-born Christianity provided a vision of salvation for everyone. As a result, Christianity received much more resource on the ecological niche of religion than ancient polytheism and continued to thrive even under the persecution of the Roman authority, while scrambling polytheism's niche and eventually made it on the wane. Similar things happened to the Aztec, when colonists superseded the primitive agricultural civilization with their advanced cultivation technologies.

It may be doubted that a civilization will be destroyed by an external might, but observation tells that military conquest alone can never collapse a civilization. A well-known counter-example is the Mongolian Empire: despite epic victories, none of the vanquished has disappeared in history, since the Mongolians could neither make any changes to the geographical environment those civilizations lived in, nor outweigh and replace them with their nomadic-styled culture which is far less energy-efficient in places other than the grasslands of inner Asia. As long as the ecological niche remains, a civilization will not collapse and eventually expel the invaders. 

In conclusion, the major reason why a civilization collapses is the loss of its ecological niche, resulted by either the disappearance of the original niche or a stronger candidate's replacement.

## In danger

Based on the view above, our civilization --- the industrialized and globalized modern civilization --- is in a sense in danger. The ecological niche can not eternally exist, and, considering the recent blooming technologies (e.g. AI), may shortly be eradicated by a coming technological revolution, not mentioning other threats like environment issues or extremist ideology. The current social formation is forged by the industrial revolution, and such formation is evidently fragile facing impact brought by new technologies. Given the history, we can not ignorantly believe that our civilization will not encounter danger.

## Evolution

However, like living species, a civilization not only dies out, but also evolves. This happens as a civilization reforms under an external selective pressure, such as environmental change or social development, usually accompanied by the collapse of the old-day civilization and the birth of the new. And the same in biological evolution happens for a civilization. Science tells that the descendant grouping necessarily contain some of the ancestor's genetic segments, while it can be learnt from history that collapsed civilizations usually will not disappear into complete void, but leave some of its adaptable characters instead, which are usually assimilated by followers. For example, the collapse of Rome not only had not ruined all its achievements, but also spread them to those previously-considered barbarian territories. Today's Europeans can not deny the fact that they are successors of the Roman civilization and part of it is still alive and influencing the modern society.

This provides a more optimistic perspective towards the collapse of civilizations, since most of them do not actually extinct, but somehow continue to exist through a fairly long time period. It is the same back to our civilization. Even though we have to admit that social development may send it to grave, we can still be proud of the fact that some of our civilization's achievements will be inherited by next generations and contribute to humanity.
