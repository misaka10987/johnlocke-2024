> Why do civilizations collapse? Is our civilization in danger?

It is common knowledge that a civilization collapses for multivariate reasons, but such reasons can be unified under the perspective of the theory of meme while involving biological methodologies in historical study.

## The meme

Every civilization can be regarded as a meme (an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme). A civilization attains energy with people's contribution to it, both cultural and technological, strengthening its power against harsh environment and discord respectively, like species consuming energy at trophic levels, and reproduces by increasing its recognition among a wider range of crowd. At the same time, all external factors --- natural or anthropogenic --- make up the biophysical environment where the civilization lives. In such meaning, a civilization acts like a living creature, which makes many biological theories applicable. Similar to a creature's extinction, it can be inducted that most civilization collapse because of loss of ecological niche.

## The ecological niche

In ecology, a niche is the match of a species to a specific environmental condition. A species occupies and thrives the niche often because it reaches a local optimum in the efficiency of the energy flowing process, which blocks its competitors out. Generally, the loss of ecological niche may be because:

- The niche has vanished as environment changes; or

- A more energy-efficient competitor has replaced the original species.

Such reasons are sound applied to civilizations. 

The civilization based on Confucianism ideology had ruled China and surrounding regions for millenniums but rapidly collapsed in the 20th century, when the long-lasted family-based agricultural mode of production was ruined by industrialization and urbanization. Those environmental changes dissolved its ecological niche --- nobody would need its social functions any more, therefore it is not surprising that Confucianism lost all its believers and faded in the new era. This phenomenon reaches an extremity when it comes to the Easter Island. The residents were the only Polynesians who had invented a writing system and built hundreds of giant statues. However, due to environmental degradation, its population had once dropped to less than $\frac 1 4$ of the peak, with the collapse of a complex social structure and retrogression of technology.

Also, a civilization's ecological niche can be taken by another one, sometimes along with conflicts or revolutions. Take the Christianity religion and the hellaenic polytheism before as an example. Instead of being only the aristocrat class's affairs, the newly-born Christianity provided a vision of salvation for everyone. As a result, Christianity received much more resource on the ecological niche of religion than ancient polytheism and continued to thrive even under the persecution of the Roman authority, while disrupting polytheism's niche and eventually made it on the wane. Similar things happened to the Aztec, when colonists superseded the primitive agricultural civilization with their advanced cultivation technologies.

It may be doubted that a civilization could be destroyed by an external might, but observation tells that military conquest alone rarely collapses a civilization. A well-known counter-example is the Mongolian Empire: despite epic victories, none of the vanquished has disappeared in history, since the Mongolians could neither make any changes to the geographical environment in which those civilizations lived, nor outweigh and replace them with their nomadic-styled culture which is far less energy-efficient in places other than the grasslands of inner Asia. As long as the ecological niche remains, a civilization will not collapse and eventually expel the invaders. 

In conclusion, the major reason why a civilization collapses is the loss of its ecological niche, resulted by either the disappearance of the original niche or a stronger candidate's replacement.

## In danger

Based on the view above, our civilization --- the industrialized and globalized modern civilization --- is in a sense in danger. The ecological niche can not eternally exist, and, considering the recent blooming technologies (e.g. AI), it may soon shortly be eradicated by a coming technological revolution, not to mention other threats like environment issues or extremist ideology. The current social formation is forged by the industrial revolution, and such formation is evidently fragile facing impact brought by new technologies. Given the history, we can not ignorantly believe that our civilization will not encounter danger.

## Evolution

However, like living species, a civilization not only dies out, but also evolves. Evolution of a civilization happens when a civilization reforms under an external selective pressure, such as environmental change or social development, and is usually accompanied by the collapse of the old-day civilization and the emergence of the new. And the same in biological evolution happens for a civilization. Science tells that the descendant grouping necessarily contain some of the genetic segments of their ancestors. It is same in history that collapsed civilizations usually will not disappear into complete void, but leave some of its adaptable characters instead, which are usually assimilated by followers. For example, Romans' achievements were not ruined by the collapse of Rome but, on the contrary, persisted and spread across regions which had previously been viewed barbaric. Modern Europeans can not deny the fact that they are successors of the Roman civilization, which is still alive and influencing the modern society.

This provides a more optimistic perspective on the collapse of civilizations, since most of them do not actually become extinct, but somehow continue to exist through a fairly long time period. It is the same back to our civilization. Even though we have to admit that social development may cause its decline, we can still be proud of the fact that some of our civilization's achievements will be inherited by future generations and contribute to humanity.
